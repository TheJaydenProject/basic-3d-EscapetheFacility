## Gameplay Overview

Escape the Facility is a time- and skill-based game where your **final score** depends on:

- **Time Taken** – Faster escapes earn higher scores  
- **Coins Collected** – The more, the better  
- **Deaths** – Fewer deaths = better score  

### Game Objectives

To survive and escape, the player must:

- Find a **Keycard** to unlock the escape door
- Equip a **Gas Mask** to survive the toxic gas zone  
- Avoid **Water Hazards** that cause instant death
- Reach the **Exit Door** to end the game 

The game ends when the player successfully reaches the **escape door**. Collecting all coins is optional but contributes to your score.

Max Score is 999 by game design.

## Known Bugs & Issues

- **Gas Hazard Damage Carryover:**  
  If the player dies to gas damage and exits the gas zone at the exact same moment, the gas damage coroutine and overlay may persist after respawning.  
  However, dying once more (after the initial respawn) resets the overlay and damage behavior correctly.
